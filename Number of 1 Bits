Problem Description:
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
Leetcode - https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/

Solution:
Convert the least significant bit to 0 (by subtracting 1) and continue till the number is greater than 0.

class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int ans = 0;
        while(n>0)
        {
            ans++;
            n = n & (n-1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
